# Lorel Popup
Simple, Elegant, Beautiful, and all of above "It's Free!!!".

A simple "POPUP" written in javascript, with state of art CSS and minimal HTML.

Design is simple, yet like an eye catching candy with a close button inspired from linux Adwaita Theme.

Very light weight, no jQuery required, with only two files ( yeah! one CSS stylesheet and another javascript code) is light like a feather weights only 6kB on disk space.

Written to be used as POPUP, also incorporates basic functionality of window objects of Alert, Confirm and Prompt, using them is as simple as originals of Windows.

How to use it. Well its as simple as making a toast.

Just include these two files in you html code, and just call "lorel.init()" with only few parameters.

	example
				lorel.init({					//this will init the POPUP(yes its name is lorel:)
					title:"This is title",		//tittle of POPUP--- optional
					content:"This is content",	//main contents of the POPUP. HTML is supported? YES.
					actions:[							//for bottom action buttons
						{value:"Ok",type:"success"},	
						{value:"cancel",type:"cancel"},
						{value:"about",type:"info"}
					]
				});
